Simulation.py includes BSM and SABR ; tradingenv.py defines the basic trading environment with fritions; memory.py includes Replaybuffer; simpleDQNagent.py defines a basic DQN agent; visual.py includes a basic plot presenting the moving average of the objective; train.py starts to train a baseline DQN model.  

This is a very preliminary project. For example, agents using other RL algorithms should be added / Prioritized replaybuffer ? / market data processor? / more plots?
